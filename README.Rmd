The **EpiBayes** package allows researchers to flexibly 
specify and fit Bayesian epidemiological models in the style of 
@Flaxman2020. The package leverages R's formula interface to paramterise the reproduction rate 
in terms of arbitrary covariates, and easily allows pooling of parameters. 
The design of the package has been inspired by, and has borrowed from, the **rstanarm** 
package [@rstanarm]. **EpiBayes** uses **rstan** [@rstan] as the backend for fitting the models.
The primary model fitting function in **EpiBayes** is `epim`.

Please see [here](/vignettes/introduction.md) for a demonstration on how to use the package. 

# Example Usage

```{r, eval = F}
library(EpiBayes)
data("EuropeCovid")

args <- EuropeCovid
args$algorithm <- "sampling"
args$formula <- R(country,date) ~ 0 + lockdown
args$prior <- shifted_gamma(shape = 1/6, scale = 1, shift = -log(1.05)/6)

fit <- do.call("epim", args)
plot_rt(fit, group = "Germany")
```
