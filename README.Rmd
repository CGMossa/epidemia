The EpiBayes package allows researchers to flexibly 
specify and fit Bayesian epidemiological models in the style of 
@Flaxman2020. The package leverages R's formula interface to paramaterize the time-varying reproduction rate 
in terms of arbitrary covariates. Multiple countries/states can be modelled simultaneously with 
multilevel models. The design of the package has been inspired by, and has borrowed from, the rstanarm
package [@rstanarm]. EpiBayes uses rstan [@rstan] as the backend for fitting models.
The primary model fitting function in EpiBayes is `epim`.

Please see [here](/vignettes/introduction.md) for a demonstration on how to use the package. 

# Example Usage

```{r, eval = F}
library(EpiBayes)
data("EuropeCovid")

# collect arguments for epim
args <- EuropeCovid
args$formula <- R(country, date) ~ 0 + lockdown
args$algorithm <- "sampling"
args$prior <- shifted_gamma(shape=1/6, scale=1, shift = -0.2)
args$group_subset <- c("United_Kingdom")

fit <- do.call("epim", args)
plot_rt(fit, group = "United_Kingdom")
```
