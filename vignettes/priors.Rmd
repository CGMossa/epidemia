# Priors on Model Parameters <img src='../man/figures/logo.png' class = "small_logo" align="right"/>
<hr>

**epidemia** aims to 
give the user a high degree of control over setting prior distributions. It does this 
by leveraging the functionality provided by **rstanarm**, which defines functions 
representing a number of different prior families. These include for example student-t, laplace, 
and hierarchical shrinkage families. In this article, we provide 
a brief introduction to the available families, and discuss some important quirks 
to be aware of when defining priors. We use the same mathematical notation as in the 
[model description article](model-description.html). 

*Please do not rely on the default priors in epidemia. Although these have been 
designed to be weakly informative, they are not guaranteed to be appropriate 
for your particular model. Please adjust prior distributions as required.*

Priors must be defined for all parameters in each of the three model components: 
transmission, infection, and observations. In the transmission model, priors must 
be set for all effects appearing in the linear predictor $\eta$. In the 
infection model, a prior must be set on $\tau$, but also on the dispersion 
parameter $d$ in the extended version of the model. In each observational 
model, priors must be set for effects defining the ascertainment rates, but also 
for the auxiliary parameter for the sampling distribution, $\phi$. 

In general, primitive model parameters are either intercepts, 
fixed effects, a covariance matrix, an auxiliary parameter, or the error term 
in a random walk. We discuss each in turn, in particular highlighting where they 
appear in the model, and what distributions are available for them.


## Priors on Intercepts

Intercepts can appear in the linear predictor $\eta$ for the reproduction numbers 
$R$ and in the linear predictors for ascertainment rates $\alpha$. The prior 
distribution is specified using an argument `prior_intercept`. This appears in 
both `epirt()` and `epiobs()`. `prior_intercept` must be a call to an 
**rstanarm** function that represents a student-t family: i.e. one of 
`rstanarm::normal`, `rstanarm::student_t` or `rstanarm::cauchy`. `prior_intercept` 
is of course only used if the formula specifies an intercept. Please note that 
the interpretation of `prior_intercept` depends on the `center` argument to 
`epirt()` and `epiobs()`. Please see Section \@ref(sec:centering) for more details.

## Priors on Regression Coefficients

In addition to intercepts, the predictors for $R$ and $\alpha$ may also contain fixed effects.
In the regression for $R$ this corresponds to the parameter vector $\beta$. The 
prior distribution is set using the `prior` argument, which, similarly to 
`prior_intercept`, appears in both `epirt()` and `epiobs()`. Note that 
this *does not* set the prior for the group-specific effects $b$, which 
are instead controlled by `prior_covariance`.

`prior` can be a call to one of rstanarm's prior functions. These can be broadly 
grouped into four families: student-t, hierarchical shrinkage, laplace and 
the product normal family. Note that *all effects must follow the same 
family*; for example, it is not possible for $\beta_1$ to have
a normal prior while $\beta_2$ has a Cauchy prior. Nonetheless, different 
hyperparameters can be set for each effect. 

As an example, suppose the following formula is used to model $R$, where 
`cov1` and `cov2` are some covariates.
```{r eval = FALSE}
R(group, date) ~ 1 + cov1 + cov2
```
Using `prior = rstanarm::normal(location=0,scale=1)` in the call to `epirt()` would 
give a standard normal prior to both covariate effects.
To give different prior locations and or scales for each covariate, 
we simply pass numeric vectors instead of scalars. 
For example, `prior = rstanarm::normal(location=c(0,1),scale=c(1,2))` would 
set priors $\beta_1 \sim N(0,1)$ and $\beta_2 \sim N(1,2)$, where $\beta_1$ 
and $\beta_2$ are the effects for `cov1` and `cov2` respectively.

The interpretation of `prior` depends on whether covariates are being centered, 
and whether automatic scale adjustments are occurring. Please see \@ref(sec:caveats) 
for more details.

### Additional Priors

In addition to **rstanarm**'s prior functions, **epidemia** offers additional 
priors for regression coefficients. Currently, there is just one, `shifted_gamma`. 
This represents a gamma distributionthat can be shifted so that it has support 
other than on $[0, \infty)$. Specifically,
\begin{equation}
\beta_i \sim \text{Gamma}(\alpha_i, \theta_i) - a_i,
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_i$ and $\theta_i$ are shape and scale parameters, and $a_i$ is a 
shift. This prior is used in @Flaxman2020 to model 
the prior effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Intuitively, it 
is unlikely that an NPI designed to reduce transmission rates ends up increasing 
transmission significantly. This implies that a symmetric prior may not be 
appropriate for these effects: it makes sense to put low mass on large positive 
effect sizes. In addition, this prior can help to improve identifiability when multiple 
NPIs occur in quick succession - as is often the case during the early stages of 
an epidemic.

## Priors on Auxiliary Parameters

Auxiliary parameters can appear in the sampling distributions for observations. 
This corresponds to the parameter $\phi$ in the model-description vignette. The 
interpretation of this parameter depends on the chosen distribution: Poisson 
has no auxiliary parameter as it is fully defined by its mean. For the 
negative binomial distribution (specified by using `family = "neg_binom"` in the 
call to `epiobs()`), $\phi$ represents the reciprocal dispersion. An auxiliary parameter $d$
also exists in the extended version of the infection model (when using `latent = TRUE` in 
the call to `epiinf()`). This represents the *coefficient of variation* of the 
offspring distribution. Auxiliary parameters are always non-negative in **epidemia**.

Priors for auxiliary parameters are set using the `prior_aux` argument in the 
`epiobs()` and `epiinf()` modeling functions. It is not used when 
`family = "poisson` in the call to `epiobs()` or when `latent = FALSE` in the 
call to `epiinf()`. `prior_aux` can be a call to one of `rstanarm::normal()`, 
`rstanarm::student_t()`, `rstanarm::cauchy()` or `rstanarm::exponential()`.

## Priors on Covariance Matrices

Recall that partial pooling can be used in the regression for $R$. The 
partially pooled parameters $b$ are characterised as zero mean multivariate 
normal with an unknown covariance matrix, which must itself be assigned a prior.
The precise model for these parameters is described in detail in the 
[partial pooling article](partial-pooling.html). The prior on the covariance 
matrix can be set using the `prior_covariance` argument in `epirt()`.

Although the Inverse-Wishart prior is a popular prior for covariance matrices, 
it does not cleanly separate shape and scale [@tokuda2011]. A general approach 
is to decompose the prior on the covariance matrix into a prior on 
the correlation matrix and a vector of variances. This is the approach taken 
by **rstanarm**, which has functions `rstanarm::decov` and `rstanarm::lkj` which 
represent priors for covariance matrices. These are also used by **epidemia** 
for the same purpose.

We briefly describe **rstanarm**'s decov prior, as it applies to partially 
pooled parameters in the regression for $R$. For a comprehensive account, 
please refer to this [article](http://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/articles/glmer.html).
 
Before reading on, it helps to review the [partial pooling vignette](partial-pooling.html).
Suppose the formula for $R$ contains a term of the form `(expr | factor)`, and 
that `expr` evaluated to a model matrix with $p$ columns, and `factor` has $L$ 
levels. Letting $\theta_l$ denote the $p$-vector of paramaters for the $l$^th^ 
group, recall from the partial pooling vignette that this is modeled as 
\begin{equation}
  \theta_{l} \sim N(0, \Sigma),
\end{equation}
where $\Sigma$ is a $p \times p$ covariance matrix. The decov prior decomposes
$\Sigma$ into a vector of variances $(\sigma^2_1, \ldots \sigma^2_p)$ and a 
correlation matrix $\Omega$, which is given an LKJ prior. The variance 
vector is decomposed into the product of a simplex vector $s$ and the trace of
$\Omega$, which is just the sum of the individual variances. Specifically,
\begin{equation}
\sigma^2_i = s_i \text{tr}\left(\Sigma\right).
\end{equation}
The simplex vector is given a symmetric dirichlet prior, while the trace is 
decomposed into $tr(\Sigma) = p \kappa^2$, where $p$ is the order of the matrix 
(i.e. the number of correlated effects), and $\kappa$ is a parameter which is 
assigned a scale invariant prior; specifically a Gamma with given shape and 
scale hyperparameters. When $p = 1$, for example with `(1 | factor)`,
the prior simplifies considerably. $\Sigma$ simply reduces to $\kappa^2$, which 
has a Gamma prior. 

## Priors on Random Walks

# Caveats {#sec:caveats}

There are several important caveats to be aware of when using prior distributions 
in **epidemia**.

## Covariate Centering {#sec:centering}

By default, covariates in the regressions for $R$ and $\alpha$ are not centered
automatically by **epidemia**. This can, however, be done by using `center = TRUE` 
in the call to `epirt()` and `epiobs()` respectively. It is important to 
note that if `center = TRUE`, the `prior_intercept` and `prior` set the priors 
on the intercept and coefficients *after centering the covariates*.

Covariates are not centered automatically because often the intercept has an 
intuitive interpretation in the model. For example, if all covariates are 
zero at the beginning of the epidemic, then the intercept can be seen as 
specifying the $R_0$ of the disease. If `center = TRUE`, then the intercept 
no longer has an easily intuited interpretation.

### Autoscaling {#sec:autoscale}

**rstanarm**'s prior functions have an arugment called `autoscale`. 
If `autoscale = TRUE`, then **epidemia** automatically adjusts the prior scale to 
account for the scale of the covariates. This only applies to priors on 
fixed effects, and not to the intercepts. **epidemia** rescales according to the 
following rules.

* If a predictor has only one unique value, no rescaling occurs.
* If it has two unique values, the original scale is divided by the range of the values.
* For more than two unique values, the original scale is divided by the standard deviation of the predictor.

If you are unsure whether rescaling has occurred, call `prior_summary` on a 
fitted model object. This gives details on the original priors specified, and 
the priors that were actually used after rescaling.
