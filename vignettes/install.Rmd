# Installation <img src='../man/figures/logo.png' align="right" height="139"/>
<hr>

epidemia requires R v3.5.0 or above. The latest version of R can be downloaded 
[here](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/).

The package can be installed directly from 
github. However, this requires you to have a working C++ toolchain. To ensure that this 
is working, please first install **rstan** by following these 
[installation instructions](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started).

After installing **rstan**, running
```{r install, eval = FALSE} 
#install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ImperialCollegeLondon/epidemia")
```
will install the latest development version of **epidemia**.

If using windows, you can alternatively install the [binary](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/epidemia/releases/latest).

Vignettes are not currently included in the package because they are
computationally demanding, and are best viewed online.
